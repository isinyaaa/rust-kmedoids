# k-Medoids Clustering in Rust with FasterPAM

This Rust crate implements k-medoids clustering with PAM and variants of clustering by direct optimization of the (Medoid) Silhouette.
It can be used with arbitrary dissimilarites, as it requires a dissimilarity matrix as input.

This software package has been introduced in JOSS:

> **Fast k-medoids Clustering in Rust and Python**  
> Journal of Open Source Software 7(75), 4183  
> <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04183> (open access)

an earlier (slower, and now obsolete) version was published as:

This is a port of the original Java code from [ELKI](https://elki-project.github.io/) to Rust.

an earlier version was published as:

## Example

```
let dissim = ndarray::arr2(&[[0,1,2,3],[1,0,4,5],[2,4,0,6],[3,5,6,0]]);
let mut meds = kmedoids::random_initialization(4, 2, &mut rand::thread_rng());
let (loss, assingment, n_iter, n_swap): (f64, _, _, _) = kmedoids::fasterpam(&dissim, &mut meds, 100);
println!("Loss is: {}", loss);
```

Note that:

* you need to specify the "output" data type of `loss` -- chose a signed type with sufficient precision.
For example for unsigned distances using `u32`, it may be better to use `i64` to compute the loss.
* the input distance type needs to be convertible into the output data type via `Into`


## Implemented Algorithms

* **FasterPAM** (Schubert and Rousseeuw, 2020, 2021)
* FasterPAM with an integrated additional shuffling step
* Parallelized FasterPAM with an integrated additional shuffling step
* FastPAM1 (Schubert and Rousseeuw, 2019, 2021)
* PAM (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1987) with BUILD and SWAP
* Alternating optimization (k-means-style algorithm)
* Silhouette index for evaluation (Rousseeuw, 1987)
* **FasterMSC** (Lenssen and Schubert, 2022)
* FastMSC (Lenssen and Schubert, 2022)
* DynMSC (Lenssen and Schubert, 2023)
* PAMSIL (Van der Laan and Pollard, 2003)
* PAMMEDSIL (Van der Laan and Pollard, 2003)

Note that the k-means-like algorithm for k-medoids tends to find much worse solutions.

The additional shuffling step for FasterPAM is beneficial if you intend to restart
k-medoids multiple times on the same data (to find better solutions).
The parallel implementation is typically faster when you have more than 5000 instances.
